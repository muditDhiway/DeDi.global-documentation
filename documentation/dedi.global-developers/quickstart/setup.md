# Setup

DeDi Global provides two environments:

* **Testing Environment** → `publish-test.dedi.global`
* **Production Environment** → `publish.dedi.global`

If you're new to DeDi, start with the **test environment**. Once you're confident, move to production.

#### Steps

1. Register on the platform.
2. Generate an **API token**.
3. Use the appropriate server:
   * Test: `test.dedi.global`
   * Production: `api.dedi.global`
