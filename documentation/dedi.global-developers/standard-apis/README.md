# Standard APIs

The DeDi Protocol defines a minimal set of standard APIs that make universal discoverability possible. Any system implementing this protocol must expose these APIs to be considered DeDi-compliant.

Currently, three API types are defined:

#### [1. Lookup API](./#id-1.-lookup-api)

#### [2. Query API](./#id-2.-query-api)

#### [3. Version API](./#id-3.-version-api)

Each serves a distinct role in navigating and retrieving hierarchical data.

#### Data Population

While the DeDi Protocol standardizes data discoverability, it does not dictate data population mechanisms.

Implementers are free to design how data is registered and updated within their systems. However, Dedi Global — provides a complete set of APIs for both data population and data retrieval.
