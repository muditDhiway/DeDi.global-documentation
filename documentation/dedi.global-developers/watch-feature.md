# Watch Feature

Similar to the **Subscribe** feature you see on platforms like YouTube—where you get instant notifications about updates from channels you follow—**DeDi** offers a powerful way to stay informed through its **Watch** feature.

### 🔔 What is Watch?

The **Watch** feature in DeDi allows you to subscribe to changes across different entities in the system. When an event occurs, you receive a notification instantly, helping you stay up-to-date with the latest activity.

### 🧭 Types of Watch

#### 1. Registry Watch

Keep a watch on a specific **registry** to get notified when:

* Registry details are updated
* A new entry or record is added
* An existing entry or record is modified

#### 2. Tag Watch

Keep a watch on a specific **tag** to get notified when:

* A registry is created using that tag
* An existing registry updates its tag to the one you are watching

#### 3. Record Watch

Keep a watch on a specific **record** to get notified when:

* The record details are updated or modified

The **Watch** feature makes DeDi more interactive and connected—helping you monitor changes that matter most to you, in real time.
